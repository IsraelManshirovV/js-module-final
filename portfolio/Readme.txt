About Me 


Hi I'm Israel, a beginning full stack web developer.
This project is my first time being involved with making A full portfolio project,
I started learning code about 5 months ago.
Before that I was producing music and my passion was to create stuff from scratch,
And with no time I change my passion to coding,
because its opens me more opportunities with my creativity and imagination I can create and design whatever I desire.
So from the first time when I started to learn to be a full stack developer I get in love with the process of coding.
my goal is to provide clean code and pixel perfect design.
my future goal is to make the website more & more interactive and responsive with JavaScript.
A responsive design makes your website accessible to all users, regardless of their devices.


In this project I made a full portfolio that represents six one pagers that they are combined as one mini website.


First there is the portfolio that speaks about me and represents 
The six pages.


When you click on the button for the "Full Project" it will transfer you to a presentation about the specific one pager and with what language the page is made from.
Then in the header there are two buttons, one of them called "Download Project",
If you press the button it will download a Zip file with all the code and the images inside it.
The second button is called "Watch project",if you press the button it will transfer you to the one pager on the website.

And that includes for all six pagers.

Also there is the logo Name "Israel Manshirov" that whenever you press on it, it will transfer you back to the portfolio.


I really enjoyed to make this project, I learned a lot from it and will be glad to make more..!!


In the future my goal is to add Javascript Elements
to make it more interactive.
